Steps to run the website locally:

1. Download the website folder which contains everything
2. Open VSCode or similar software or download VSCode
3. Open the folder within VSCode(will give you the option to select a folder upon startup)
4. In the folder, look to open up a new terminal, also make sure to have everything downloaded especially an up-to-date version of NodeJS.
5. In the terminal make sure to install all the dependencies by running npm install into the terminal
6. After having everything downloaded onto your local environment then you can now type npm start into the terminal 
7. You should get a localhost URL within your terminal now and basically, all you have to do is copy and paste the URL within a browser. 
8. You should now be able to see the development build of the website with updates occurring automatically if you change anything.
